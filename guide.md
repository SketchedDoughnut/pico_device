A guide to configuring your pico running CircuitPython!

Any files in BootFiles should be put in the root directory, in a boot.py file.

Any files in Devices should be put in a folder named Devices, with whatever filename you choose. Just remember you will import this for usage.

Any files in ButtonMaps should be in a folder named ButtonMaps inside of Devices, with whatever filename you choose. Just remember you will import this for usage.

Thanks, enjoy!
